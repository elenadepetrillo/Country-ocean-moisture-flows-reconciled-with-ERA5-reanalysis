This repository provides the codes developed to retrieve the input data of moisture connections for the methodology developed in the work "Reconciling tracked atmospheric water flows to close the global freshwater cycle" (2024) authored by Elena De Petrillo, Simon Fahrländer, Marta Tuninetti, Lauren Andersen, Luca Monaco, Luca Ridolfi, and Francesco Laio, Communications Earth&Environment, 2025

Input data are the UTrack moisture connections data, obtainted from the Lagrangian-based (forward trajectory) tracking model (DOI UTrack dataset: 10.1594/PANGAEA.912710, DOI UTrack support paper: 10.5194/essd-12-3177-2020).

The output data of the study are available on Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10400695.
